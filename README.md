# TeachMeChess

The Online Chess Application is a web-based platform that allows users to play chess against each other online, and also provides personalized chess coaching using a custom AI model for each user. The application is built using a modern software architecture, with a focus on performance, scalability, and user experience.

## Software Architecture

The software architecture of the Online Chess Application is based on a microservices architecture, with separate services for the backend API, game engine, AI model training, and user data management. The backend API is built using a RESTful architecture, with endpoints for user authentication, game management, and AI model training. The game engine is responsible for managing the state of each game, handling user moves, and sending real-time updates to the frontend. The AI model training service is responsible for training personalized AI models for each user based on their game history and performance. The user data management service is responsible for storing and retrieving user data, including session data and AI model data.

## Technologies Used

The Online Chess Application is built using a range of modern technologies, chosen for their performance, scalability, and ease of use. These technologies include:

- **Go**: Go is used as the primary programming language for the backend API and game engine, due to its built-in support for concurrency, simple and efficient syntax, and low memory footprint.

- **Rust**: Rust is used as the primary programming language for the frontend using the Yew framework, due to its performance, safety, and ability to compile to WebAssembly.

- **PostgreSQL**: PostgreSQL is used as the backend database for the application, due to its reliability, scalability, and support for advanced features like JSON data types.

- **Redis**: Redis is used as the caching layer for the application, due to its fast performance, low memory footprint, and support for advanced data structures like sets and hashes.

- **Docker**: Docker is used as the containerization platform for the application, allowing for easy deployment and management of the various microservices.

Overall, the combination of these technologies provides a powerful and flexible platform for building an online chess application that is fast, reliable, and scalable.
